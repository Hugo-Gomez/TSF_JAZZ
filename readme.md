<h1>LPDW_Jazz Project</h1>

This website is an update of the Tsf Jazz Website, a french jazz radio. We are a group of students and we do this for a school project of our Professionnal License in Web Development.

<h5>There is no commercial purpose on this project or anything that we can exploit or take out of Tsf Jazz Radio business.</h5>

<p>To run the website, it's pretty easy. Just open the TSF_JAZZ folder in your terminal and run this command :</p>
<p>docker-compose up -d</p>

To access to the website, url is : localhost:8080/server.php/
To acces to the phpmyadmin interface, url is : localhost:8181
